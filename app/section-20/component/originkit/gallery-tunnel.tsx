/**
 * Ported from the units.gr hero — a minified webpack bundle, rebuilt from the
 * class that drove it.
 *
 * A tunnel of segments rushes past the camera forever. Every other segment is
 * papered with slabs: each slot is a coin flip between an image and a block of
 * colour, and only about half the slots take one at all, so the walls never
 * settle into a pattern. Hold the pointer down and the whole thing accelerates —
 * that is what "Press to Start" is asking for.
 *
 * The original leaned on GSAP for two tweens and a 10000vh spacer for page
 * scroll. Neither is here: the spacer was a red herring (the tunnel drives itself
 * off its own velocity, never off scroll position), and two eases are not worth a
 * dependency.
