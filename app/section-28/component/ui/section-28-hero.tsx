/**
 * Figma "Frame 2147262014" (1:1306) — Creatora mobile hero, 402 x 779.
 *
 * The whole screen is pinned to the background grid: the nav plate, the copy
 * plate and the creator tiles all start on a column rule, and the vertical
 * rhythm is the 73px row pitch. So the flow below is a single column laid out
 * with the grid's own numbers — nav 25 -> 96, dot band 97 -> 170, copy
 * 290 -> 514, tiles 546 -> 618 and 671 -> 743, then the 36px tail that closes
 * the frame at 779.
 *
 * Content padding is 18/17 rather than a flat 16 because Figma's plates span
 * 18 -> 385: they stop just inside the outer column rules so those two rules
 * stay visible through the nav and the headline block, which is what reads as
 * the frame's left and right edge.
 *
 * Only the decoration Figma itself places absolutely stays absolute — the grid,
 * the two #f5f5f5 washes, the dot halo, and the markers that sit *on* rule
 * intersections rather than in the flow.

 *
 * The two left-hand tiles peel at 300 rather than the default 240, so the flap
