/**
 * The accretion disc and the hand under it — Figma mobile 2356:514,
 * iPad 2356:784, desktop 2356:1285.
 *
 * Figma ships the disc as a flat PNG, but it is a still of exactly this
 * OriginKit component, so it runs live here instead. Its parameters were
 * recovered from that render rather than guessed:
 *
 *   - the lit pixels have a principal axis at -19.94deg, which is the roll the
 *     component's default `tiltSideway` of 160 produces; Figma then rotates the
 *     whole image a further -2.28deg, so 158 lands the disc at the -22.0deg it
 *     actually sits at on screen and the wrapper needs no rotation of its own
 *   - the projected ellipse measures 0.237 minor over major. Without
 *     perspective that ratio would be sin(tilt); with the component's fixed
 *     1300 depth it comes out at tilt 12
 *   - the art spans 82.6% of the render's width, which needs `outerRadius` 75
 *     rather than the default 70 (79 by the arithmetic, trimmed to 75 after
 *     diffing the running disc against the frame)
 *
 * `voidRadius` is absolute pixels inside the component, not a share of the box,
 * so it cannot be a Tailwind variant and it cannot be a constant either: the
 * disc is 715px wide on desktop and 403px on mobile. It is scaled off the
 * measured width instead, which also keeps it right between breakpoints. The
 * integer rounding is what stops a resize drag re-seeding the particle field on
 * every pixel — one unit of void is about 20px of box.
 *
 * The box itself is one aspect ratio at every frame; only its width and where
 * it hangs on the page change. Because of that the hand lands at the same
 * percentages of the box at all three sizes, so it needs no per-breakpoint
 * geometry at all.
 *
 * Desktop hangs the box off the middle band's centre rather than the stage top.
 * Figma puts it at y76 in a 173-643 band, i.e. 76px above that centre, and
 * holding the offset means the disc and the copy drift down by the same amount
 * when the band opens up on a viewport taller than Figma's 811.

/**
 * Figma masks the hand with an ellipse under a 13.05px blur, at 50% opacity.
 * A blurred edge is a Gaussian one — alpha at distance d from a boundary R is
 * about Phi((R - d) / sigma) — and the source keeps sigma at 0.1203 of the
 * radius on all three frames, so a single gradient serves every size. The stops
 * run to 1.45R because that is where the falloff finally reaches zero; the
 * wrapper below is sized to that full extent, which is what makes
 * `closest-side` resolve to exactly the right radii.

          Figma puts this box at 50.19%; it sits at 47.19% — three points up.
          The offset is on the box rather than on the `<img>` inside it so the
          mask travels with the hand: moved on the image alone, the hand slides
          out from under its own vignette and the falloff stops matching the
          fingers. Everything here is a percentage of the visual, so the lift
          re-pitches with the frame instead of drifting at one width. */}
