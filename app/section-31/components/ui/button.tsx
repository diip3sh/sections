 * The bracketed CTA — Figma 2356:1076 (filled) and 2356:1082 (ghost), identical
 * at all three frames at 156 x 51.
 *
 * Figma builds the brackets as four 10px squares carrying a top and right
 * border, each rotated or mirrored into its corner. Two borders per corner say
 * the same thing without the transforms, so they are written that way.
 *
 * The ghost variant ships its brackets at opacity 0 — they exist in the file
 * but are invisible, which only reads as a rest state for a hover. They fade in
 * on hover here rather than shipping four nodes that never paint.
