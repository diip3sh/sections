/**
 * Headline, sub and CTA pair — Figma mobile 2356:491, iPad 2356:767,
 * desktop 2356:1071.
 *
 * Centred on the two stacked frames, left-aligned in the desktop's left column.
 * The headline holds its own line break at every width (Figma sets it nowrap),
 * so it is written as two lines rather than left to wrap.
 *
 * Figma nudges the mobile block 3px right of centre (left 50% + 3px); it is
 * centred here, since nothing else in the frame carries that offset.
 *
 * The CTA pair measures exactly 332 — the full width of Figma's mobile block —
 * so it wraps rather than clips on anything narrower than the 402 frame.
 *
 * Desktop hangs off the middle band's centre rather than the stage top: Figma
 * puts the block at y226 in a 173-643 band, which is 31px above that band's
 * centre, and holding the offset rather than the absolute y is what lets the
 * band grow on a tall viewport without stranding the copy at the top.
