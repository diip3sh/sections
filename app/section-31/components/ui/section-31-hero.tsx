/**
 * Figma frames:
 * - Mobile  2356:481  — 402 x 1233
 * - iPad    2356:751  — 744 x 1330  (`ipad:`)
 * - Desktop 2356:1021 — 1440 x 811  (`desktop-sm:`), stage capped at 1920
 *
 * The frame heights are load-bearing. Every rule, band and block in this design
 * is placed against a ruled grid at a fixed frame y, and the two stacked frames
 * are more than half again as tall as the desktop one because they run copy,
 * visual, stats and brands down a single column where desktop sets copy against
 * visual either side of a middle rail. So the stage carries all three heights
 * and each block is positioned into it, rather than flowed.
 *
 * Desktop width is the Figma 1440 frame opened to a 1920 cap: rails, nav and
 * content share that stage so the wordmark and "Start Free" stay on the outer
 * rails past 1440. The visual is the other fluid piece — `BlackHoleVisual`
 * takes its width as a share of the stage, so the disc keeps its place relative
 * to the rails through the stretch instead of hanging off a 1440-only number.
 *
 * Height is two decisions, not one. `<main>` takes `min-h-dvh` so the page runs
 * to the bottom of any screen. The stacked frames keep their own heights — they
 * are already taller than the phones and tablets they run on. Desktop takes
 * Figma's 811 as a floor and follows the viewport up to 1142, past which the
 * bands drift so far apart that the design reads as three strips rather than one
 * screen; beyond that the surplus is background below the stage. `--stage-h`
 * carries that one number, and `--band-h` the middle band it leaves once the nav
 * (173) and the stats-and-brands band (168) have taken their fixed share — the
 * visual sizes itself off it, so a wide short viewport cannot push the disc
 * through the rule below it. The middle band is transparent to the pointer so it
 * cannot swallow nav clicks.
