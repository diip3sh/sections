/**
 * Top nav — Figma 2394:4967 (mobile) / 2394:5007 (tablet) / 2394:5055 (desktop).
 *
 * A wordmark against a hamburger below 1280, and against a link row plus an
 * outlined CONTACT above it. Its bottom edge is the first of the section's
 * rules — the whole design is a stack of bands divided by them, so each band
 * carries its own.
 *
 * Figma centres the desktop links on 700 rather than 720 — twenty pixels left of
 * the frame centre, which is where they were dragged rather than a relationship
 * to anything. They are centred here, the way `section-30` centres its own.
