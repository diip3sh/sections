/**
 * ASCII fire along the bottom edge (Figma "image 3083614" / "3083615", plus the
 * wedge-masked "image 3083582" above them).
 *
 * Figma ships three baked crops of one render. Desktop splits the band into a
 * 790px and a 507px slice at different vertical offsets, which leaves a visible
 * seam at x861, and hangs a second copy above it clipped by a hand-drawn wedge
 * to fake extra sparse dots trailing up the right side. One live field replaces
 * all three: thinning upward is what the fire simulation does, so the wedge has
 * nothing left to describe — and it was a 1440-only shape that would not have
 * survived any other width.
 *
 * The band spans rail to rail in every frame (317 of 318 on the phone, 639 of
 * 640 on the tablet, 1297 of 1296 on desktop — Figma is a pixel out either way),
 * so it is expressed as the rail inset rather than as three widths.
 *
 * Glyph size is not a prop: the component draws at a fixed 10px monospace, which
 * measures 6px per column and 10.5px per row. Sampling the frames gives exactly
 * that pitch, so the band needs no scaling at any breakpoint.

       * sit near the top of the ramp and the band renders about twice Figma's
       * ink; 70 puts base heat near 0.55, which is where the frames sit.
