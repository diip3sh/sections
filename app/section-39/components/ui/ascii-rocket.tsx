/**
 * The shuttle, rendered as ASCII (Figma "image 3083579" — 2428:7810 / 7747 /
 * 7687).
 *
 * The shuttle is angled 48.1deg, but the canvas is not — the source image is
 * pre-rotated instead (`rocket-rotated.png`, generated from `rocket.png`) and
 * the canvas stays axis-aligned. That is what makes the hover reveal usable: the
 * component maps the pointer through getBoundingClientRect, which reports an
 * axis-aligned box, so under a CSS rotation the revealed blob lands rotated away
 * from the cursor. Rotating the pixels instead of the element keeps the pointer
 * maths exact. The cost is that the glyph rows run horizontally where Figma runs
 * them along the shuttle.
 *
 * Sizes follow from that. The canvas is the box the shuttle's own ink occupies
 * on screen once rotated — 374.24x352.56, and 0.5868 of that on the phone —
 * measured by rotating Figma's own ASCII render and taking its alpha bounds. It
 * has to be the rotated *ink*: the shuttle never filled its 520x546 canvas, so
 * turning that canvas corner-to-corner gives 498x480 and draws it a third too
 * big. Rotation about the centre preserves
 * the centre, so the anchor offsets are unchanged: the canvas is placed on its
 * Figma centre with `left/top-1/2` plus the offset from the box's own centre,
 * which keeps it put when the box is narrower than its Figma width.
 *
 *   phone  centred at (+16.71, -27.28) of a 318.62x213 box
 *   tablet centred at (+28.5, -46.5) of a 543x363 box
 *
 * `columns` is a fixed count, not the usual count-from-a-fixed-pitch, and that
 * is deliberate: Figma scales one 1008px render to both sizes, so the column
 * count holds while the glyphs shrink with the box. Deriving from a pitch
 * instead would hold glyph size and drop the phone to ~85 columns, losing detail
 * the frames keep. Measured off Figma's render the count is 144; 200 draws the
 * shuttle finer than the frames do.
 *
 * Pointer events are the reason `reveal` behaves differently per frame, and the
 * split is deliberate. The rotated canvas takes a 754x752 bounding box, which on
 * the phone covers the two CTAs sitting above it and on desktop reaches up over
 * the nav. So the box stays inert until `desktop-sm`, where the only thing it
 * overlaps is the nav — and the nav is z-30 above it, so its button still takes
 * the click. That also puts the reveal exactly where it is useful: it is a
 * pointermove effect, so it has nothing to do on a touch frame.
 *
 * Caveat worth knowing: the component maps the pointer through
 * getBoundingClientRect, which reports the axis-aligned box and ignores the
 * 48.1deg rotation, so the revealed blob sits rotated away from the cursor —
 * close to the centre, further out toward the edges.
