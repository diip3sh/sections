 * Bracket corners (Figma 2428:7799–7802). Four 10px squares, each showing the

 * `border-r border-t` square rotated four ways; naming the sides directly is the
 * same pixels without the transforms.
 *
 * "Explore Missions" carries the identical four squares at opacity 0 — Figma's
 * way of keeping both buttons on one component. That zero is not a spare part:
 * it is the resting half of a hover, so the `ghost` variant renders the same
 * four and fades them to the primary's 0.5 on pointer-over. Nothing moves and
 * nothing is added on hover that the design does not already draw.
 *
 * `group-hover` is written bare rather than behind
 * `[@media(hover:hover)_and_(pointer:fine)]`. That gated form is used widely in
 * this repo but was measured emitting no rule at all, and a hover that compiles
 * to nothing is the thing being fixed here. Opacity-only, so a touch device
 * that latches :hover shows the brackets and nothing shifts.
