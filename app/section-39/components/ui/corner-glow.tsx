/**
 * Top-left light shard (Figma "Polygon 1" 2428:7754 / 7703 / 7657) — a small
 * white triangle under six stacked gaussian drop-shadows plus a 100px
 * foreground blur. That filter stack is the whole effect and it does not reduce
 * to a CSS wash, so it ships as the SVG; everything around it is CSS.
 *
 * Figma masks the glow with two opaque #0a0a0a rectangles: one the width of the
 * left rail, one the height of the nav band. Both exist only to cut the glow
 * off, and both leave a hard edge that is clearly visible in the frames. Here
 * the same two edges come from clipping this box to the nav's bottom and the
 * rail's inner edge, which is the same pixels without painting two black plates
 * over the background.
 *
 * The inner nesting is Figma's own: a 178x188 centring box, a 138.34deg
 * rotation, and the SVG hung off a 70.683x189 core at the percentage insets its
 * blur padding needs. Left and top are re-based by the rail width and the nav
 * height, since this box now starts at that corner rather than at the frame's:
 * Figma's (-58,-31) / (-85,-21.01) / (-35,-11) less (42,56) / (52,79) / (72,96).
