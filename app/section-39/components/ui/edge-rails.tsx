/**
 * Ruled edge rails (Figma "Mask group" 2428:7759 / 7762 and their phone and
 * tablet twins).
 *
 * Figma ships these as a #d9d9d9 plate at 20% clipped by a texture PNG. Sampling
 * that PNG shows it is not a texture at all but a strict repeat: one 2px stripe
 * at full mask alpha, then a second at 30% alpha exactly half a period later.
 * So it rebuilds as one repeating-linear-gradient, which matters here because
 * the rails run the whole height of a min-h-dvh section — a stretched PNG mask
 * would re-pitch itself every time the viewport height changed, while the
 * gradient holds Figma's spacing at any height.
 *
 * The period is re-pitched per frame, not scaled: 23 / 29 / 40. Rail width and
 * the hairline on the inner edge follow the same three-value pattern.
