/**
 * Drifting light streaks (Figma "Star 22" 2428:7757 / 7706 / 7701).
 *
 * Figma bakes this as a 9.4MB PNG, so it is rebuilt with the live component.
 *
 * The burst originates at the top-right corner of the content area — where the
 * right rail's inner edge meets the nav rule — and fans down and left across the
 * section. `centerX`/`centerY` are percentages of this host and the component
 * clamps them to 0-100, so rather than compute a centre, the host *is* the
 * content area: rails on either side, nav rule on top, stage bottom below. Its
 * top-right corner is then the origin, which is what 100/0 means, and the box
 * needs no numbers of its own. Spoke length is the host's diagonal, so the rays
 * die exactly as they reach the far corner at any viewport size.
 *
 * The light those streaks come out of is the same Figma node but a separate
 * layer here — see `star-glow.tsx`, which paints on that corner at `z-30` while
 * the field stays at `z-[1]` under the copy.
 *
 * Taking Figma's rotation off the burst costs nothing — the spokes are radially
 * symmetric with seeded random phases.
 *
 * Blending is `plus-lighter` as in Figma, which also makes the component's
 * opaque black background a no-op instead of something to work around.
